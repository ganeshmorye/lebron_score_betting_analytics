# LeBron James Points Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict the points scored by LeBron James in his first regular season game in the 2023-24 season, specifically the game between the LA Lakers and the Denver Nuggets in Denver on October 24, 2023. The model leverages historical game data and player statistics, with a focus on transforming these into rolling averages to capture recent performance trends more accurately.

## Business Objective
The goal is to provide a robust predictive model that can inform betting strategies by accurately forecasting player performance, specifically the number of points LeBron James is expected to score.

## Data Collection
Data was collected using Sportradar's API, which provides detailed NBA game statistics. The data collection process involved retrieving LeBron's seasonal statistics and game-by-game data for the last 10 seasons, with special attention given to his tenure with the LA Lakers to ensure relevance and consistency in the predictive model.

## Data Transformation
The raw data was transformed into rolling averages to smooth out the performance fluctuations and emphasize recent trends, which are more indicative of future performance. This transformation included creating new features and incorporating additional game context such as game location, date, and team dynamics.

## Modeling
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated, with the Random Forest, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) models showing particular promise. The models were assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric to ensure a fair and robust performance measure.

## Conclusions

The LeBron James Points Prediction project has yielded several key insights:

- **Model Performance**: The predictive models, particularly the Support Vector Regressor (SVR) and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR), were able to forecast LeBron James' points with a reasonable degree of accuracy, suggesting that machine learning can be a valuable tool in sports analytics.

- **Feature Significance**: The project identified critical features that significantly influence predictions, such as 'field goals made'. This reinforces the importance of in-game performance metrics in predicting overall player scoring.

- **Effectiveness of Rolling Averages**: Rolling averages proved to be an effective method for feature engineering in this context, smoothing out individual game variances and highlighting trends that are more predictive of future performances.

- **Challenge of Overfitting**: The initial models experienced overfitting, indicated by a disparity between training and testing performance. This was addressed through model refinement and cross-validation, underscoring the necessity of thorough model evaluation.

- **Cross-Validation Reliability**: The use of cross-validation provided a reliable measure of the model's predictive power, reflecting its potential to generalize to new, unseen data.

- **Data Preprocessing and Quality**: Extensive data preprocessing, including the handling of null values and the creation of new features, such as date-based indicators, contributed to the robustness of the predictive models.

- **Practical Application**: The insights and models generated from this project could have practical applications, such as informing betting strategies or player performance projections, demonstrating the real-world value of the analysis.

In essence, the project demonstrates a successful application of data science techniques in the domain of sports analytics, from data collection through to modeling and evaluation. While the models developed are promising, sports prediction is a complex domain, and there is always scope for further enhancement, particularly in improving the model's ability to generalize and thus its utility in practical scenarios.
