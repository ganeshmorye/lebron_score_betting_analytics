# LeBron James Points Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to predict the points scored by LeBron James in his first regular season game in the 2023-24 season, specifically the game between the LA Lakers and the Denver Nuggets in Denver on October 24, 2023. The model leverages historical game data and player statistics, with a focus on transforming these into rolling averages to capture recent performance trends more accurately.

## Business Objective

The goal is to provide a robust predictive model that can inform betting strategies by accurately forecasting player performance, specifically the number of points LeBron James is expected to score.

## Data Collection

Data was collected using Sportradar's API, which provides detailed NBA game statistics. The data collection process involved retrieving LeBron's seasonal statistics and game-by-game data for the last 10 seasons, with special attention given to his tenure with the LA Lakers to ensure relevance and consistency in the predictive model.

## Data Transformation

The raw data was transformed into rolling averages to smooth out the performance fluctuations and emphasize recent trends, which are more indicative of future performance. This transformation included creating new features and incorporating additional game context such as game location, date, and team dynamics.

## Modeling

Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated, with the Random Forest, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) models showing particular promise. The models were assessed using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric to ensure a fair and robust performance measure.

## Model Performance Analysis

The model performance was evaluated using the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), which provides a measure of the average magnitude of the predictive errors.

### Key Performance Metrics:

- **Training RMSE for the SVR Model**: 7.14
- **Testing RMSE for the SVR Model**: 8.21
- **Training RMSE for the Gradient Boosting Model**: 6.39
- **Testing RMSE for the Gradient Boosting Model**: 8.63

### Discussion:

- **Support Vector Regressor (SVR) Performance**:
  - The SVR model achieved a training RMSE of 7.14, which is relatively low, indicating a good fit on the training data.
  - The testing RMSE was 8.21, slightly higher than the training RMSE. This increase suggests that the model performs reasonably well on unseen data, although there might be a slight overfitting as the model performs better on the training data.

- **Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) Performance**:
  - The Gradient Boosting model showed a training RMSE of 6.39, which is quite low, indicating the model fits the training data well.
  - The testing RMSE increased to 8.63, which is slightly higher than the SVR's testing RMSE. This suggests that the Gradient Boosting model might not generalize as effectively as the SVR model, although the difference is fairly minimal.

## Conclusion:

- **Generalization Gap**: Both models show a gap between training and testing RMSE, with the Gradient Boosting model having a slightly wider gap. This suggests a potential overfitting issue, where the model learns the training data well but does not generalize as effectively to new data.
  
- **Performance Trade-offs**: The trade-offs between the SVR and GBR models are apparent in their respective RMSE scores. The GBR model fits the training data slightly better than the SVR model, but this does not translate to better performance on the test data.

- **Robustness of Models**: Despite the differences in performance, both models are reasonably robust, given their complexity and the difficulty of the task. Predicting exact points for a player in a specific game involves variables and randomness that can be challenging to capture fully in a model.

- **Feature Significance**: The project identified critical features that significantly influence predictions, such as 'field goals made'. This reinforces the importance of in-game performance metrics in predicting overall player scoring.

- **Effectiveness of Rolling Averages**: Rolling averages proved to be an effective method for feature engineering in this context, smoothing out individual game variances and highlighting trends that are more predictive of future performances.

- **Challenge of Overfitting**: The initial models experienced overfitting, indicated by a disparity between training and testing performance. This was addressed through model refinement and cross-validation, underscoring the necessity of thorough model evaluation.

- **Data Preprocessing and Quality**: Extensive data preprocessing, including the handling of null values and the creation of new features, such as date-based indicators, contributed to the robustness of the predictive models.

- **Practical Application**: The insights and models generated from this project could have practical applications, such as informing betting strategies or player performance projections, demonstrating the real-world value of the analysis.

In essence, the project demonstrates a successful application of data science techniques in the domain of sports analytics, from data collection through to modeling and evaluation. While the models developed are promising, sports prediction is a complex domain, and there is always scope for further enhancement, particularly in improving the model's ability to generalize and thus its utility in practical scenarios.

## Next Steps:

- **Model Improvement**:
  - To improve the models, it may be beneficial to explore additional feature engineering, model tuning, or different modeling techniques that could provide a better balance between training performance and generalization to test data.
  
- **Feature Reevaluation**:
  - Considering the feature importance scores and the overfitting observed, it would be prudent to reassess the features used in the model, potentially removing those that contribute to overfitting or that do not have significant predictive power.

- **Incorporating Domain Knowledge**:
  - The models could potentially be improved by incorporating more domain knowledge about basketball, such as player fatigue, travel schedules, or other contextual factors that may affect performance.

The RMSE scores provide a benchmark for the current models' performance, setting a foundation for future iterations and improvements to enhance the accuracy and reliability of LeBron James' points predictions.
